 * ### Challenge `processFirstItem`
 *
 * @instructions
 * Implement a higher-order function called `processFirstItem`.
 * It takes two arguments:
 * @param stringList an array of strings.
 * @param callback function that takes a string as its argument.
 * @returns the result of invoking `callback` with the FIRST element in `stringList`.
 *
 * Example of usage of this higher-order function:
 * Invoking `processFirstItem` passing `['foo', 'bar']` and `(str) => str + str`,
 * should return 'foofoo'.

/* Task 1: `counterMaker`
 * Study the code for counter1 and counter2. Answer the questions below.
 *
 * 1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
 * counter1 is a callback function for counterMaker...counter2 is a stand-alone (?) fumction that increments count
 * 2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
 * counter1...i has to reach outside it's scope to process counterMaker
 * 3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better?
 * in most cases i'd think counter1 to be preferable unless there was only one thing to count and that variable could be global in which case counter2 would be acceptable

/* Task 2: inning()

Write a function called `inning` that generates a random number of points that a team scored in an inning. This should be a whole number between 0 and 2. */

/* Task 3: finalScore()

Write a higher order function called `finalScore` that accepts the callback function `inning` (from above) and a number of innings and and returns the final score of the game in the form of an object.

For example,

finalScore(inning, 9) might return:
{
  "Home": 11,
  "Away": 5,
}

*/

}

/* Task 4:

Create a function called `scoreboard` that accepts the following parameters:

(1) Callback function `getInningScore`
(2) Callback function `inning`
(2) A number of innings

and returns the score at each pont in the game, like so:

1st inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
2nd inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
3rd inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
4th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
5th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
6th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
7th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
8th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
9th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam

Final Score: awayTeam - homeTeam */
